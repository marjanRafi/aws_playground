# ☁️ AWS Playground

Welcome to my **AWS Playground** – a hands-on sandbox for learning, experimenting, and building with Amazon Web Services. This repository showcases my exploration of cloud-native architectures, IaC, automation, and DevOps workflows on AWS.

---

## 🚀 What’s Inside

- 🏗️ **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**  
  Terraform, AWS CDK, and CloudFormation templates to provision cloud resources.

- 🔁 **CI/CD Pipelines**  
  GitHub Actions and Jenkins pipelines deploying to S3, EC2, Lambda, etc.

- 📦 **Serverless Applications**  
  Experiments with AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and Step Functions.

- 🐳 **Containers & Orchestration**  
  ECS with Fargate, EKS (Kubernetes), and Docker deployments.

- 🔐 **Security & IAM**  
  IAM policies, KMS key usage, best practices in cloud security.

- 📊 **Monitoring & Observability**  
  Using CloudWatch, X-Ray, and custom logging/alerting integrations.

## 🧠 Learning Goals

- Master AWS core services like EC2, S3, IAM, Lambda, and RDS.
- Build real-world-ready CI/CD workflows using GitHub Actions and Jenkins.
- Use IaC tools like Terraform to create scalable, reusable infra modules.
- Monitor, secure, and automate AWS environments following DevSecOps principles.
